# pypower

**pypower** is a package for auto and cross power spectrum and associated window function estimation,
for periodic boxes, survey geometry, in the flat-sky or plane-parallel (plus first odd wide-angle corrections) configurations.

A typical auto power spectrum estimation is as simple as:
```
import numpy as np
from pypower import CatalogFFTPower

kedges = np.linspace(0., 0.2, 11)
# pass mpiroot=0 if input positions and weights are not MPI-scattered
result = CatalogFFTPower(data_positions1=data_positions1, data_weights1=data_weights1, randoms_positions1=randoms_positions1, randoms_weights1=randoms_weights1,
                         edges=kedges, ells=(0, 2, 4), boxsize=1000., nmesh=512, resampler='tsc', interlacing=2, los=None, position_type='pos')
# wavenumber array in result.poles.k
# multipoles in result.poles.power
```

Example notebooks presenting most use cases are provided in directory nb/.

## Documentation

Documentation is hosted on Read the Docs, [pypower docs](https://pypower.readthedocs.io/).

## Requirements

Only strict requirements are:

  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pmesh (can be ignored if data types only are required, to e.g. load precomputed power spectra / window functions)

To enable faster spherical harmonics computation:

  - sympy
  - numexpr

## Installation

### pip

Simply run:
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/cosmodesi/pypower
```

### git

First:
```
git clone https://github.com/cosmodesi/pypower.git
```
To install the code:
```
python setup.py install --user
```
Or in development mode (any change to Python code will take place immediately):
```
python setup.py develop --user
```
